1.  Introduction

   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) provides means for
   network applications to obtain network information.  For example, the
   Endpoint Cost Service (ECS) defined by ALTO in [RFC7285] can provide
   the network costs of data transmissions from a set of sources to a
   set of destinations.  The costs (called distances) then can be used
   by Rucio to rank data sources or destinations to make data
   orchestration decisions, where Rucio is the de facto data
   orchestration system of CERN experiments.

   As another example, to extend FTS, which is the data scheduling
   system of CERN experiments, to realize resource allocation to
   multiple experiments sharing the same network link, the ongoing TCN
   project need the ALTO path vector service to map each source-
   destination pair to the links used by the pair.  The project then
   computes the total traffic sent by each activity of each experiment
   on a given link, where each experiment consists of a set of
   activities, each activity consists of a set of data transfers, and
   each data transfer has a given source-destination pair.  With the
   aggregation, TCN computes scheduling of data transfers according to
   resource allocation policies.

Internet-Draft                  ALTO TIPS                     March 2023


   In the definitions of ALTO services ([RFC7285] and existing
   extensions), there is no requirement on whether the source and the
   destination endpoints must belong to the same autonomous network,
   which is a single-domain setting, or they can belong to different
   autonomous networks, which is a multi-domain setting.  The
   unification of a single interface covering both single-domain and
   multi-domain settings provides a simple-to-use interface to ALTO
   clients.  However, it leaves standardization gaps in multi-domain
   settings.  Although participating autonomous systems can define
   private mechanisms to realize ALTO services in multi-domain settings,
   standard mechanisms allow wider deployment.

   This document first specifies the issues that may arise in providing
   ECS in multi-domain settings.  It then provides initial designs,
   based on current implementation experiences to start the design
   conversation.  To be concrete, this document is based on the basic
   ALTO ECS service.  Additional complexities such as network maps and
   cost maps will be discussed in the next iteration.

2.  Multi-domain Problem

2.1.  Use Cases

   Consider the following ECS query realizing ALTO ECS for LHCONE to
   support Rucio.  The source is located at CERN and the destination
   candidates are at multiple locations of the LHCONE network (BNL,
   Caltech, and KIT, for example).

           "ipv4:141.3.128.6"  : 10
         }
       }
     }

   It is straightforward to change the query to be the ALTO path vector
   service, to support TCN: the value is a vector of network links
   (e.g., [link-1, link-2, ...]), not the numerical routingcost (e.g.,
   20).

   The use cases provide examples of multi-domain settings, which the
   figure below shows.  We choose one of the destinations as an example.
   For such a query, the path from src to dst spans multiple autonomous
   networks.

   +-------------+     +---------+   +-----+   +------------+

2.2.  Challenge: Distributed Information

   In the Internet setting which we consider, the network information of
   the path from the src to the dst spreads into multiple autonomous
   networks: 4 autonomous networks (AS A, B, and D) in the example.  BGP
   collects information from multiple autonomous networks through back
   propagation from the destination, but the information is coarse-
   grained, and incomplete.

   Source: The BGP router at AS S knows that the path from src to dst
   consists of the AS-PATH [S A B D].  Combining BGP and intradomain
   routing, AS S will also know which one of the two egress routers
   (se1, se2) that it will use to forward traffic to dst.  However, AS S
   does not know more details downstream: for example, it does not know
   whether the packet will use ae1 or ae2 as the egress router at AS A
   to enter AS B; neither does it know the internal routing inside AS A.
   Hence, an ALTO server provided by AS S cannot provide all of the
   information for the example ECS query.

   Non-Source AS: A non-source AS knows the AS-PATH starting from itself
   to dst.  But it may not know the ingress point.  For example, AS A
   does not know whether the packet will come in from ai1 or ai2.
   Hence, an ALTO server provided by AS A may consider the example ECS
   query as an ambiguous query (because it gives only source (src) and
   destination (dst), but it does not in general know the ingress
   point).

2.3.  Challenge: Partial Deployment

   It is possible to design protocol extensions to collect the
   aforementioned distributed information to provide complete
   information (see below), but one challenge is that the deployment may
   be only incremental and hence is partially deployed during the
   process.  Consider the example, assume that AS B will run only
   standard protocols (also no traceroute) and will not provide extended
   ALTO, then the ingress point to D will be ambiguous.

3.  Candidate Solutions

   During the process of integrating ALTO into Rucio and FTS, multiple
   solution candidates are discussed and below we enumerate each of
   them.

3.1.  Candidate Solution: Routing Layer Design

   This is a type of solution that makes it possible to collect all
   needed network information at a single autonomous network, and then
   use an ALTO server at the source network to abstract and expose the
   information.  One natural candidate is to modify the routing control
   plane itself: BGP extensions, which can be extended to collect needed
   information and propagate upstream.  For example, when a BGP router
   at AS A (e.g., ai1) propagates BGP info to its peer at AS S (se1), it
   includes not only the AS-PATH [A, B, D], but also additional
   information so that the upstream can construct the complete path cost
   (distance) metrics.  The upside of this design is that it integrates
   with routing system and hence may even extend routing capabilities.
   However, routing protocol extensions can be complex in deployment.
   Further, it provides a different trust model: the original ALTO model
   is a star trust model, with the application (e.g., Rucio/FTS) at the
   hub and each AS needs to trust the application.  The BGP extension
   model requires the trust of peers and recursive peers (BGP community
   may be used to impose policies).

3.2.  Candidate Solution: Data-Path Sampling/Collection

   This is a type of solution that allows data path to collect control
   plane information.  For example, a traceroute based system called
   PerfSonar is widely deployed.  Such a system can collect other
   network information such as delay and loss naturally as measurements.
   However, this type of solution typically cannot collect full topology
   information such as link capacity or handle more complex query such
   as ALTO Path Vector.

Internet-Draft                  ALTO TIPS                     March 2023


3.3.  Candidate Solution: Multi-Domain ALTO Composition Refinement

   This is an ALTO based system, and consists of two components: (1) it
   introduces a new abstraction of each autonomous network and
   associated query process to allow multi-domain ALTO information
   composition; and (2) it introduces a generic-path model at ALTO
   clients so that they can use the acquired information to gradually
   refine network information.

3.3.1.  ALTO Server Multi-Domain Information Model

   In the ALTO base model, a network is a container, with endpoints
   attached to the big switch.  In the multi-domain model, each network
   (represented by an ALTO server) has a set of ingress points (in-1 to
   in-m) and a set of egress points (e-1 to e-n).  An endpoint belonging
   to the network will be attached to an ingress point and an egress
   point.  Hence, a single-domain ALTO query will specify ingress and
   egress directly attached to an ingress point and an egress point.  A
   source network, to a destination that is not in the same network,
   however, will only return the egress point; a destination network,
   when the source is from a different network, will need an ingress
   point.  A general transit network will need an ingress point and
   return egress point.  For consistency, the egress point must be a
   valid ingress point, represented by a unique address, of the peer.

                  ----|             |----
               in-m   +-------------+  e-n

   ALTO Server Multi-domain Query Model: Each ECS query, if the src is
   not in the home domain of the ALTO server, should include an ingress
   point, where the ingress point is returned by the ALTO server of the
   previous domain.  If the domain of the ALTO server is not the home
   domain of the destination, the ALTO server should return the egress
   point of the home domain and the ingress of the network domain.

   As an optional feature, the query should allow indication of
   iterative or recursive queries.

Internet-Draft                  ALTO TIPS                     March 2023


   To support incremental deployment, an ALTO server may respond to a
   query without specifying an ingress point and the source is not in
   the domain of the ALTO server.  In this case, the ALTO server will
   return the results from each potential ingress points.  For each
   ingress point indicated, the server indicates information of the
   previous hop (e.g., peer AS number and potential address).

3.3.2.  ALTO Client General-Path Model

   In particular, it allows the path from a src to a dst to be a
   directed acyclic graph, with the following components:

   A set of nodes, where each node has both a type, and attributes,
   where the type can be (1) host: such as src/dst, with attributes such
   as IP address; (2) AS: which is a group of nodes, i.e., subgraph,
   with attributes including ASN; (3) router, with subtypes such as BGP-
   router, with attributes such as IP address.

   A set of links, where each link has a head and a tail; hence the
   types of links will be the unique combinations of head-type x tail
   type.  A link can have its attributes as well.

   Now, some examples of this representation in our deployment use case:

   For the geo-distance ALTO cost derived from geo-ip: the src is a host
   and the dst is also a host, and the metric is the geo distance;

   For CERN looking glass ALTO server, from a src host in CERN to a dst
   host in another network, say KIT, the src is a host, with two links,
   one for each of the two looking glass BGP routers from cern; each of
   these BGP routers links to its BGP peer, and each such BGP peer links
   to the next AS, in the AS-PATH exposed by CERN.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Some of the solutions will need IANA registrations.
