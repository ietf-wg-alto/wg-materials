                ALTO Multi-Domain Use Cases and Services
                    draft-yang-alto-multi-domain-02

Abstract

   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) provides means for
   network applications to obtain network information.  Although ALTO is
   inherently multi-domain, in that the ALTO server representing the
   network and the ALTO client requesting the network information belong
   to different trust domains, there are more general cases where the
   path from the source and the destination spans multiple autonomous
   networks, which we call multi-domain settings.  This document first
   gives 3 multi-domain use cases, and the challenges to address the
   challenges.  It then gives a brief update on the implementation
   solutions that we explored to address the challenges.

Internet-Draft              ALTO Multi-Domain                  July 2023


1.  Introduction

   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) provides means for
   network applications to obtain network information.  For example, the
   Endpoint Cost Service (ECS) and the Cost Map Service (CMS) defined by
   ALTO in [RFC7285] can provide the network-path properties (e.g.,
   routing costs, or relative ranking) of data transmissions from a set
   of source network locations to a set of destination network
   locations.  The Path Vector Service allows ALTO to provide bandwidth
   availability (bottlenecks) for a given set of flows defined by a set
   of source-destination pairs.

   Although such services can provide values when only a single network,
   called a single-domain, provides these services, there are many use
   cases where multiple networks, called multi-domains, can be involved
   from a given source to a given destination.  [RFC7971] states that
   "The ALTO protocol is designed for use cases where the ALTO server
   and client can be located in different organizations or trust
   domains.  ALTO is inherently designed for use in multi-domain
   environments.  Most importantly, ALTO is designed to enable
   deployments in which the ALTO server and the ALTO client are not
   located within the same administrative domain."

   This document first specifies three multi-domain use cases.  It then
   discuss the two challenges when deploying ALTO in multi-domain
   settings.  At the end, this document provides initial designs, based
   on current implementation experiences to start the design
   conversation.

2.  Multi-domain Use Cases

   To be concrete, this document uses 3 use cases from the context of
   data-intensive sciences for CERN/WLCG.

2.1.  Multi-domain Path Distance/Ranking for Rucio

   The data orchestration system of CERN/WLCG is Rucio, which selects a
   source for a given downloading client, when multiple sources provide
   the data set.  Rucio also conducts destination selection, when
   multiple destinations can be the target locations for replication.

   The main mechanism of source/destination selection in Rucio is
   distance, which is a perfect match for ALTO cost services; see
   appendix for a review of the full source/destination mecahnism of
   Rucio.  Specifically, consider the following ECS query realizing ALTO
   ECS for Rucio to do destination selection.  The source is located at
   CERN and the destination candidates are at multiple locations of the
   LHCONE network (BNL, Caltech, and KIT, for example).

           "ipv4:141.3.128.6"  : 10
         }
       }
     }

   The use case provide an example of a multi-domain setting, because
   the source and the desintations are located at different networks and
   the network paths span multiple autonomous networks.  Figure 1 below
   illustrates a network path from src to dst spanning 4 networks.

2.2.  Multi-domain Path -> Link Mapping for FTS

   The data transport scheduling system of CERN/WLCG is FTS, which
   schedules given transfers, where a transfer has a fixed dataset, a
   source and a destination (for example, chosen by Rucio).

   One main function of FTS is to satisfy operator resource constraints.
   As an example, FTS may schedule concurrent transfers from CERN to
   CalTech and KIT, under the constraint that the total transmission
   rate for a given link should be within a threshold.

   Consider Figure 1.  Assume S is CERN and D is CalTech.  The network
   path from CERN to CalTech uses the top inter-AS link (se1->ai1), and
   the network path from CERN to KIT uses the lower inter-AS link
   (se2->ai2).  For FTS to know how much demand it is placing on each
   one of these two links to stay within the constraint of each link,
   FTS needs to know the network paths, and the paths span multiple
   autonomous networks.

2.3.  Multi-domain Resource Discovery for NOTED/SENSE

   An emerging capacity for LHCONE/WLCG is the ability to create new
   paths to obtain additional capacity when there is high demand from a
   given source storage element (SE) to a destination element (SE).  In
   particular, the NOTED project monitors the backlog at Rucio/FTS for
   each source SE, destination SE pair, and may decide to create a path
   if one pair has a large backlog.

   To identify available networking capacity, ALTO Path Vector Service
   (PVS) is an ideal service.  However, as we see from Figure 1, the
   setting can be a multi-domain setting.

3.  Multi-domain Challenges

   Although implementing ECS/CMS/PVS is relatively straightforward in a
   single domain, there are challenges implementing these services in
   multi-domain settings.

3.1.  Challenge: Distributed Information

   Consider Figure 1, to compute the total routing cost of the path from
   the src to the dst.  The routing costs will consist of multiple
   segments spanning 4 autonomous networks: (1) from src to the link
   connecting the egress of AS S (se1) and the ingress of AS A (ia1);
   (2) from the ingress of A to the ingress of B; (3) from the ingress
   of B to the ingress of D; ( 4) from the ingress of D to dst.

   One may think that BGP collects information from multiple autonomous
   networks through back propagation from the destination, and hence
   includes information for all 4 segments.  But BGP information is
   distributed, coarse-grained, and incomplete.

   Source: The BGP router at AS S knows that the path from src to dst
   consists of the AS-PATH [S A B D].  Combining BGP and intradomain
   routing, AS S will also know which one of the two egress routers
   (se1, se2) that it will use to forward traffic to dst.  However, AS S
   does not know more details downstream: for example, it does not know
   whether the packet will use ae1 or ae2 as the egress router at AS A
   to enter AS B; neither does it know the internal routing inside AS A.
   Hence, an ALTO server provided by AS S cannot provide all of the
   information for the example ECS query.

   Non-Source AS: A non-source AS knows the AS-PATH starting from itself
   to dst.  But it may not know the ingress point.  For example, AS A
   does not know whether the packet will come in from ai1 or ai2.
   Hence, an ALTO server provided by AS A may consider the example ECS
   query as an ambiguous query (because it gives only source (src) and
   destination (dst), but it does not in general know the ingress
   point).

3.2.  Challenge: Partial Deployment

   It is possible to design protocol extensions to collect the
   aforementioned distributed information to provide complete
   information (see below), but one challenge is that the deployment may
   be only incremental and hence is partially deployed during the
   process.

4.  Solution Space Exploration

   During the process of integrating ALTO to support the Rucio and FTS
   use cases, multiple potential solutions are implemented.  Below we
   discuss them briefly to motivate discussions.

4.1.  Solution Space to Obtain Forwarding Information Bases (FIBs)

   Obtaining FIBs is a basic building block of implementing ALTO route-
   related visibility services.  At a high-level, FIBs have the
   following life cycle:

   FIB-Configure/input:
      Consider a network as a distributed system.  Then the input to the
      distributed system is the input to the components: the routers.
      The input to each router is its configuration, and external input
      such as BGP routes from peers outside the network.

   FIB-Compute:
      The distributed system computes the FIBs using a distributed
      protocol (or configured by a logically centralized control plane).
      During the computing process, the vendor specific configuration
      may be turned into standard format such as IGP information model.

   FIB-Apply:
      The FIBs are computed and then applied.  When FIBs are applied to
      data packets, the application may be observed by NetFlow/sFlow or
      similar capturing capabilities; it may also be applied to control
      mechanisms such as traceoute, which can be observed.

4.2.  FIB-Compute Based Design

   This is a type of solution that makes it possible to extends FIB-
   Compute to compute all needed network information at a single
   autonomous network, addressing the distributed information challenge.
   Assume that use an ALTO server at the source network to abstract and
   expose the information.  One natural candidate is to modify the
   routing control plane itself: BGP extensions, which can be extended
   to collect needed information and propagate upstream.  For example,
   when a BGP router at AS A (e.g., ai1) propagates BGP info to its peer
   at AS S (se1), it includes not only the AS-PATH [A, B, D], but also
   additional information so that the upstream can construct the
   complete path cost (distance) metrics.

   The upside of this design is that it integrates with routing system
   and hence may even extend routing capabilities.  However, routing
   protocol extensions can be complex in deployment.  Further, it
   provides a different trust model: the original ALTO model is a star

   trust model, with the application (e.g., Rucio/FTS) at the hub and
   each AS needs to trust the application.  The BGP extension model
   requires the trust of peers and recursive peers (BGP community may be
   used to impose policies).

4.3.  FIB-Apply Based Design

   This is a type of solution that allows data path to collect control
   plane information.  For example, a traceroute based system called
   PerfSonar is widely deployed in our setting.  It is also natural to
   use NetFlow/sFlow to identify ingress points.  Such a system can
   collect other network information such as delay and loss naturally as
   measurements.

   However, this type of solutions can have many issues.  For example,
   traceoute has issues including anonymous routers, uncertain router IP
   resulting in node aliasing; load balancing routing resulting in link
   aliasing.

4.4.  Multi-Domain Cascading ALTO

   This is a model that is presented by Ingmar Poese as Cascading ALTO
   at IETF 116.  For Cascading ALTO by Poese, please see his IETF 116
   slides.

   In the ALTO base model, a network is a container, which we call a big
   switch, with endpoints attached to the big switch.  In the multi-
   domain model, each network (represented by an ALTO server) has a set
   of ingress points (in-1 to in-m) and a set of egress points (e-1 to
   e-n).  An endpoint belonging to the network will be attached to an
   ingress point and an egress point.  Hence, a single-domain ALTO query
   will specify ingress and egress directly attached to an ingress point
   and an egress point.  A source network, to a destination that is not
   in the same network, however, will only return the egress point; a
   destination network, when the source is from a different network,
   will need an ingress point.  A general transit network will need an
   ingress point and return egress point.  For consistency, the egress
   point must be a valid ingress point, represented by a unique address,
   of the peer.

   ALTO Server Multi-domain Query Model: Each ECS query, if the src is
   not in the home domain of the ALTO server, should include an ingress
   point, where the ingress point is returned by the ALTO server of the
   previous domain.  If the domain of the ALTO server is not the home
   domain of the destination, the ALTO server should return the egress
   point of the home domain and the ingress of the network domain.

   As an optional feature, the query should allow indication of
   iterative or recursive queries.

   To support incremental deployment, an ALTO server may respond to a
   query without specifying an ingress point and the source is not in
   the domain of the ALTO server.  In this case, the ALTO server will
   return the results from each potential ingress points.  For each
   ingress point indicated, the server indicates information of the
   previous hop (e.g., peer AS number and potential address).

4.5.  General-Path Model Supporting Partial Deployment

   Complementing the cascading model, we introduced a generic-path model
   at ALTO clients so that they can use the acquired information to
   gradually refine network information.

   In particular, it allows the path from a src to a dst to be a
   directed acyclic graph, with the following components:

   A set of nodes, where each node has both a type, and attributes,
   where the type can be (1) host: such as src/dst, with attributes such
   as IP address; (2) AS: which is a group of nodes, i.e., subgraph,
   with attributes including ASN; (3) router, with subtypes such as BGP-
   router, with attributes such as IP address.

   A set of links, where each link has a head and a tail; hence the
   types of links will be the unique combinations of head-type x tail
   type.  A link can have its attributes as well.

   Now, some examples of this representation in our deployment use case:

   For the geo-distance ALTO cost derived from geo-ip: the src is a host
   and the dst is also a host, and the metric is the geo distance;

   For CERN looking glass ALTO server, from a src host in CERN to a dst
   host in another network, say KIT, the src is a host, with two links,
   one for each of the two looking glass BGP routers from cern; each of
   these BGP routers links to its BGP peer, and each such BGP peer links
   to the next AS, in the AS-PATH exposed by CERN.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Some of the solutions will need IANA registrations.
