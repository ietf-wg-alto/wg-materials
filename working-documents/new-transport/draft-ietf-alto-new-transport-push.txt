      ALTO New Transport: Server Push using PUSH_PROMISE of HTTP/2
                 draft-ietf-alto-new-transport-push-00

Abstract

   The ALTO base protocol [RFC7285] defines both the ALTO information
   resources and their transport from the server to the client.  Using
   HTTP/1.x as the transport protocol, the ALTO transport in the base
   protocol includes the limitations of HTTP/1.x.  ALTO/SSE [RFC8895]
   defines a new transport design addressing some of the limitations,
   but is still based on HTTP/1.x.  This document introduces ALTO new
   transport, which introduces ALTO transport information structures
   (TIS) at an ALTO server.  The introduction of ALTO TIS allows at
   least two types of efficient transport using HTTP: (1) HTTP/2/3
   independent client long poll allowed by non-blocking, newer HTTP, and
   (2) HTTP/2 specific server push.  This document defines ALTO TIS and
   the first design.  This document defines server-push ALTO transport
   based on ALTO TIS.

1.  Introduction

   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) provides a means for
   network applications to obtain network status information.  The ALTO
   base protocol [RFC7285] is based on the sequential request and
   response model of HTTP/1.1 [RFC7230].  Hence, the base protocol
   cannot support well the use cases where an ALTO client may need to
   efficiently monitor the changes to a set of network information
   resources.  If the client opens a single HTTP connection, the request
   for one resource may block the request for the next resource.

   To address the issue using a protocol that is still based on the
   HTTP/1.1 transport model, the ALTO Working Group introduces ALTO/SSE
   (ALTO Incremental Update based on Server-Sent-Event) [RFC8895], so
   that an ALTO client can manage (i.e., add and remove) a set of
   requests maintained at an ALTO server, and the server can
   continuously, concurrently, and incrementally push updates whenever a
   monitored network information resource changes.  Figure 1 shows the
   architecture and message flow of ALTO/SSE, which can be considered as
   a more general transport protocol than the ALTO base transport
   protocol.  Although ALTO/SSE allows the concurrent transport of
   multiple ALTO information resources, it has complexities and
   limitations.  For example, it requires that the server provide a
   separate control URI, leading to complexity in management; it needs
   its own envelop protocol on top of HTTP encoding to indicate message
   types.

             Figure 1: ALTO SSE Architecture and Message Flow.

   This document specifies ALTO New Transport, which realizes ALTO/SSE
   functions but takes advantage of newer versions of HTTP (e.g., HTTP/2
   [RFC7540]) that support concurrent, non-blocking transport of
   multiple streams in the same HTTP connection.

2.  ALTO New Transport Design Requirements

   ALTO New Transport is designed to satisfy a set of requirements.
   First, it should satisfy the following requirements to realize the
   functions of ALTO/SSE:

   *  R0: Client can request any resource using the connection, just as
      using ALTO base protocol using HTTP/1.x.

   *  R1: The client can request the addition (start) of incremental
      updates to a resource.

   *  R2: The client can request the deletion (stop) of incremental
      updates to a resource.

   *  R3: The server can signal to the client the start or stop of
      incremental updates to a resource.

   *  R4: The server can choose the type of each incremental update
      encoding, as long as the type is indicated to be acceptable by the
      client.

Internet-Draft                   ALTO/H2                    October 2022


   Following the ALTO framework [RFC7285] [RFC7971], ALTO New Transport
   should still be HTTP based:

   *  R5: The design follows the basic principle of HTTP---
      Representational State Transfer and hence can use only HTTP verbs
      (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD).

   ALTO New Transport should be designed to take advantage of newer HTTP
   design features, in particular, parallel transfers, but be as
   transparent to versions (HTTP/2, HTTP/3) as possible.  If a design is
   based on a particular HTTP version, it should respect its semantics:

   *  R6: The design respects specific HTTP semantics such as the
      semantics of PUSH_PROMISE, if the feature is used.

   To allow flexible deployment, the new transport protocol should be
   flexible, in particular,

   *  R7: The design should support capability negotiation.

3.  ALTO New Transport Design Overview

   A key design of ALTO New Transport is to distinguish between
   information about ALTO resources and information about ALTO
   transport.  It introduces the following transport information
   structures to distribute ALTO information resources:

   *  The transport state from the ALTO server to an ALTO client (or a
      set of clients) for an ALTO information resource is conceptually
      through a transport queue.  A static ALTO information resource
      (e.g., Cost Map, Network Map) has a single transport queue, and a
      dynamic ALTO information resource (e.g., Filtered Cost Map) may
      create a queue for each unique filter request.

   *  Each transport queue maintains two states: (1) the incremental
      update message queue, which includes a sequence of incremental
      update messages and (2) the receiver set, which includes the set
      of receivers receiving incremental push updates from the ALTO
      server.

   *  The transport queue state is exposed to clients through views;
      that is, a client can see only a virtual view of the server state.

   Figure 2 shows an example illustrating the aforementioned
   information.  Each ALTO client (Client 1, Client 2, or Client 3)
   maintains a single HTTP/2 connection with the ALTO server.

   The basic work flow of a client connecting to an ALTO server is the
   following:



       Client opens a connection to the server
       Client opens/identifies a transport queue tq
         // pull mode
         Client requests transport queue status of tq
         Client requests an element in the incremental update queue

         // push mode
         Client becomes a receiver
         Client receives incremental push updates
       Client closes the transport queue tq
       Client closes the connection


            Figure 3: ALTO New Transport Information Structure.

4.  Transport Queue

4.1.  Transport Queue Operations

   A transport queue supports three basic operations (CRD): create, read
   (get status), and delete.

   Create a transport queue: An ALTO client creates a transport queue
   using the HTTP POST method with ALTO SSE AddUpdateReq ([RFC 8895]
   Sec. 6.5) as the parameter:


       object {
           ResourceID   resource-id;
           [JSONString  tag;]
           [Boolean     incremental-changes;]
           [Object      input;]
        } AddUpdateReq;



   A successful POST request MUST return the URI for the transport
   queue.  Unless the request has incremental-changes to be false, the
   client is added to receiver set as well, indicating that the client
   will receive automatic, incremental push updates.

Internet-Draft                   ALTO/H2                    October 2022


   Read a transport queue: A client reads the status of a transport
   queue by issuing a GET request to the transport queue URI returned
   from the POST method.

   Delete a transport queue: a transport queue exposed to a client can
   be closed (deleted) either explicitly or implicitly.

   *  Explicit delete: A client uses the HTTP DELETE method to
      explicitly delete a transport queue.  If successful, the transport
      queue is deleted from the local view of the client, although the
      server may still maintain the transport queue for other client
      connections.

   *  Implicit delete: Transport queue for a client is ephemeral: the
      close of the HTTP connection between the client and the server
      deletes the transport queue from the client's view --- when the
      client reconnects, the client MUST NOT assume that the transport
      queue is still valid.

   Error codes: ALTO/H2 uses HTTP error codes.

4.2.  Examples

   The first example is a client creating a transport queue.

      Client -> server request

      HEADERS
        - END_STREAM
        + END_HEADERS
          :method = POST
          :scheme = https
          :path = /tqs
          host = alto.example.com
          accept = application/alto-error+json,
                       application/alto-transport+json
          content-type = application/alto-transport+json
          content-length = TBD

      DATA
       - END_STREAM
       {
          "resource-id": "my-routingcost-map"
       }

Internet-Draft                   ALTO/H2                    October 2022


      Server -> client response:

      HEADERS
        - END_STREAM
        + END_HEADERS
          :status = 200
          content-type = application/alto-transport+json
          content-length = TBD

      DATA
        - END_STREAM
         {"tq": “/tqs/2718281828459”}



   The client can then read the status of the transport queue using the
   read operation (GET) in the same HTTP connection.  Below is an

5.1.  Incremental Updates Queue Operations

   Among the CRUD operations, an incremental updates queue supports only
   the read operation: a client cannot create, update, or delete
   incremental updates queue directly---it is read only, and associated
   with transport queue automatically.

   Reads an incremental updates queue: A client reads the status of an
   incremental updates queue using the HTTP GET method: GET transport-
   queue-uri/uq, where the transport-queue-uri is the URI returned in
   the transport queue create method.

   The response informs the client the backlog status, and potential
   direct links.  Specifically, the response is a JSON array, with each
   element being one incremental update, with three required fields and
   one optional field:

   *  "seq": a required JSON integer indicating the sequence number of
      the incremental update; As JSON allows a large integer space, when
      the server reaches the largest integer, the server SHOULD close
      the incremental update queue;

   *  "media-type", a required JSON string giving the type of the
      incremental update (see ALTO/SSE);

   *  "tag": a required JSON string giving a unique tag (see [RFC7285];

   *  "link": an optional JSON string giving an optional link for a
      client to directly request a resource as a complete snapshot (not
      through incremental updates).

   Note that the server determines the state (window of history and type
   of each update) in the incremental updates queue, as specified by
   [R4].

5.2.  Examples

   Assume the same example in the preceding section.  The client can
   check the status of the incremental updates queue of a transport
   queue from the same connection:

6.  Individual Updates

6.1.  Individual Updates Operations

   A client can only read an individual update.  The read can be either
   pull read issued by the client or a push from the server to the
   client.

Internet-Draft                   ALTO/H2                    October 2022


   Client pull read: A client uses HTTP GET method on the incremental
   updates queue concatenated by a sequence number to pull an individual
   update.

   Server push read: a client starts to receive server push when it is
   added to the receiver set.  A client can add itself to the receiver
   set when creating the transport queue, or add itself explicitly to
   the receiver set (see the next section).

   The work flow of server push of individual updates is the following:

   *  Initialization: the first update pushed from the server to the
      client MUST be the later of the following two: (1) the last
      independent update in the incremental updates queue; and (2) the
      following entry of the entry that matches the tag when the client
      creates the transport queue.  The client MUST set
      SETTINGS_ENABLE_PUSH to be consistent.

   *  Push state: the server MUST maintain the last entry pushed to the
      client (and hence per client, per connection state) and schedule
      next update push accordingly.

   *  Push management: The client MUST NOT cancel (RST_STREAM) a
      PUSH_PROMISE to avoid complex server state management.

6.2.  Examples

   The first example is a client pull example, in which the client
   directly requests an individual update.

7.  Receiver Set

7.1.  Receiver Set Operations

   Among the CRUD operations, a client can add to or delete itself from
   the receiver set of a transport queue.  It can also read the status
   of the receiver set.

   Creat: A client can add itself in the receiver set by using the HTTP
   PUT method: PUT transport-queue/rs/self

   Read: A client can see only itself in the receiver set.  The
   appearance of self in the receiver set (read does not return "not
   exists" error) is an indication that push starts.

   Delete: A client can delete itself (stops receiving push) either
   explicitly or implicitly.

Internet-Draft                   ALTO/H2                    October 2022


   *  Explicit delete: A client deletes itself using the HTTP DELETE
      method: DELETE transport-queue/rs/self.

   *  Implicit delete: Transport queue is connection ephemeral: the
      close of connection or stream for the transport queue deletes the
      transport queue (from the view) for the client.

7.2.  Examples

   A client can stop incremental push updates from the server to itself
   by sending the request:

      DELETE /tqs/2718281828459/rs/self HTTP/2
      Accept: application/alto-transport+json


      HTTP/2 200 OK

8.  ALTO/H2 Stream Management

8.1.  Objectives

   A main benefit of using HTTP/2 for ALTO is to take advantage of
   HTTP/2 streams.  In particular, the objectives of ALTO/H2 include:

   *  Allow stream concurrency to reduce latency

   *  Minimize the number of streams created

   *  Enforce dependency among streams (so that if A depends on B, then
      A should be sent after B)

   *  Encode dependency to enforce semantics (correctness)

   To realize the objectives, ALTO/H2 MUST satisfy the following stream
   management requirements in all 4 phases specified in the next 4
   subsections.

8.2.  Client -> Server [Create Transport Queue]

   Each request to create a transport queue (POST) MUST choose a new
   client selected stream ID (SID_tq), with the following requirements:

   *  Stream Identifier of the frame is a new client-selected stream ID;
      Stream Dependency in HEADERS is 0 (connection) for an independent
      resource, the other transport queue if the dependency is known.

   *  Invariant: Stream keeps open until close or error.

Internet-Draft                   ALTO/H2                    October 2022


8.3.  Client -> Server [Close Transport Queue]

   DELETE to close a transport queue (SID_tq) MUST be sent in SID_tq,
   with the following requirements:

   *  Stream Identifier of the frame is SID_tq, and Stream Dependency in
      HEADER is 0 (connection), so that a client cannot close a
      different stream.

   *  HEADERS indicates END_STREAM; server response SHOULD close the
      stream.

8.4.  Client -> Server [Request on Data of a Transport Queue on Stream
      SID_tq]

   The request and response MUST satisfy the following requirements:

   *  The Stream Identifier of the frame is a new client-selected stream
      ID, and Stream Dependency in HEADERs MUST be SID_tq, so that a
      client cannot issue request on a closed transport queue;

   *  Both the request and the response MUST indicate END_STREAM.

8.5.  Server -> Client [PUSH_PROMISE for Transport Queue on Stream
      SID_tq]

   The server push MUST satisfy the following requirements:

   *  PUSH_PROMISE MUST be sent in stream SID_tq to serialize to allow
      the client to know the push order;

   *  Each PUSH_PROMISE chooses a new server-selected stream ID, and the
      stream is closed after push.

8.6.  Concurrency Management


   *  ALTO/H2 must allow concurrency control using the
      SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS option in HTTP/2.

   *  From the client to the server direction, there MUST be one stream
      for each open transport queue, and hence a client can always close
      a transport queue (which it uses to open the stream) and hence can
      also close, without the risk of deadlock.

   *  From the server to the client direction, each push needs to open a
      new stream and this should be controlled bu
      SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS.

   Note that it is straightforward for an ALTO sever to run HTTP/2 and
   support concurrent retrieval of multiple resources such as "my-
   network-map" and "my-routingcost-map" using multiple HTTP/2 streams
   with the need to introducing ALTO/H2.

   The resource "update-my-costs-h2" provides an ALTO/H2 based
   connection, and this is indicated by the media-type "application/
   alto-transport+json".  For an ALTO/H2 connection, the client can send
   in a sequence of control requests using media type application/alto-
   updatestreamparams+json.  The server creates HTTP/2 streams and
   pushes updates to the client.

10.  Security Considerations

   The properties defined in this document present no security
   considerations beyond those in Section 15 of the base ALTO
   specification [RFC7285].

11.  IANA Considerations

   IANA will need to register the application/alto-transport+json media
   type under ALTO registry as defined in [RFC7285].

12.  Acknowledgments

   The authors of this document would also like to thank many for the
   reviews and comments.

Appendix A.  Outlook to ALTO with HTTP/3

   This draft is focusing on HTTP/2 enhancement of the ALTO protocol and
   the design takes advantage of HTTP/2 design features such as parallel
   transfer and respects HTTP/2 semantics (e.g., PUSH_PROMISE).  Since
   QUIC and HTTP/3 respectively are coming up for various protocols on
   the Internet it is understandable that the question arises, if ATLO
   could also take advantage of the advantages of HTTP/3.  QUIC can be
   seen as a replacement for TCP+TLS+HTTP2.  HTTP/3 bases on the QUIC
   transport protocol and uses UDP instead of a TCP connection.

   QUIC has been developed by the IETF QUIC Working Group with the
   following goals:

   *  Minimizing connection establishment and overall transport latency
      for applications, starting with HTTP/2

   *  Providing multiplexing without head-of-line blocking

   *  Requiring only changes to path endpoints to enable deployment

   *  Enabling multipath and forward error correction extensions

   *  Providing always-secure transport, using TLS 1.3 by default

   If HTTP/3 is not supported, it automatically runs on HTTP/2.  The
   prerequisite for HTTP/3 is that both client and server support it.

   The basic assumption is that an implementation that runs on HTTP/2
   should also run-on HTTP/3.  This should be transparent.  HTTP/3 uses
   "well known port" UDP 443 analogous to TCP 443.  The network between
   client and server must not filter HTTP/3.

   Since many applications still using HTTP/2 it is mandatory for ALTO
   to support this protocol first.  This ensures compatibility.
   Therefore, this document describes the update of ALTO from HTTP/1.x
   to HTTP/2.  The usage of HTTP/3 will be described in a separate
   document so that compatibility of ALTO with HTTP/3 will be ensured in
   a later stage.
